# stream-data-store-retrieval-with-mongodb

For this project, I've built a lightweight spring boot application that simulates an IoT data stream. It doesn't interact with real devices, but instead generates random data to represent sensor readings.

In addition, I've implemented a separate mechanism for storing and retrieving specific metrics reported by different device types.
